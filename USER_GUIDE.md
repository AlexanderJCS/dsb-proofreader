# User Guide

This user guide will explain how to proofread spines. At the end, you will have a CSV containing head center names, radii, 3D positions, index, and label (assigned by you, a human proofreader).

Ensure that you have already [installed the proofreading software](INSTALL.md) and have a `.dsb` file.

## Opening a DSB file

First, run the proofreader. You'll see a menu with a button prompting you to open a DSB file. Click it.

Then, choose a DSB file to load.

The program may freeze for up to one minute while it loads the DSB file and initializes the visualization.
